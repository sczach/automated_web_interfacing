# automated_web_interfacing
Clist offers a somewhat well-ordered platform for me to practice navigating through i/o on local data, website hierarchies, and algorithmic design. 

I in no way support, use, or will use this to post anything on clist. Honestly, this is practice for me in automation of trivial things.

clist_automated_posting.py
  Description: Takes input CSV data and posts to pertinent local clist listings.
  
  Requirements: input CSV data in particular format
  
  Headers: email, city, zip, link, title, body
  
    A link, for example to a survey, can be any text added at the end.
    
  Limitations: Does not currently support maps and locations. Also is somewhat slow & clunky - must load entire page, and with bad internet (mine) it takes ~1 minute to navigate to data entry dialogue.
